	   Title Of Simulation

		<h4>
			The spatial distribution of headwaters catchments that experience high Ali stream
concentrations is controlled by numerous factors including catchment characteristics such as
topography, vegetation, soil depth, and bedrock and till composition. In addition to spatial
variability, stream water chemistry in headwaters has been shown to vary among flow regimes
from snowmelt in the spring to low flow in the summer. There are very few studies that address
controls on stream chemistry, especially aluminum concentrations, at the landscape level (e.g.,
Palmer et al., 2005) or compare water quality across flow regimes at large scales (Cory et al.,
2006). Understanding stream chemistry variation in headwaters in the White Mountain region is
essential because headwaters account for a large proportion of New Hampshire’s river basins
where first-order headwater streams comprise >40% of the river basin area (Nadeau and Rains,
2007). Even though headwaters have been responding to reductions in acidic deposition,
including declines in Ali concentrations (Kahl et al., 2004; Palmer and Driscoll, 2002); many
these headwaters may still be vulnerable to chronic or episodic Ali mobilization. Additionally,
data only exists for a small number of streams in the region. Thus, it is important to assess the
variability of Ali concentrations across the White Mountain region and to understand the controls
on spatial patterns in headwaters. This information will be useful for policymakers as new water
quality standards for surface waters in the state are con
